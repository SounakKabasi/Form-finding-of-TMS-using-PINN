# Form-finding-of-TMS-using-PINN
The form-finding of frame-supported tensile membrane structure is performed by solving the modified Laplace equation using physics-informed neural networks.
Works with tensorflow 1.15
Two files are required- one for (x,y,z) coordinates of boundary collocation points and another one for (x,y) coordinates of the domain collocation points.
The files for complex tms 2 and comples tms 3 are uploaded in this repository.
